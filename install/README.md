# Install HELICS

Installs HELICS from a release.

`version` input can be used to set what the version should start with (e.g. v2, v3), and `prefix`can be used to specify the full path for where to install HELICS.

The `version` output contains the version tag that was installed, and the `prefix` output contains the HELICS install prefix.
